## Disclaimer: Content Warning

#### This capstone project involves the analysis of social media content, including tweets that may contain hate speech and offensive language. The objective of this project is to explore methods for identifying and understanding such harmful content, and not to promote or endorse it in any way.

#### The content you will encounter in this project may contain explicit language, discriminatory remarks, or offensive terminologies. This includes but is not limited to slurs related to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, or other protected characteristics. I strongly condemn such behavior, but include these data in my project for the purpose of creating models that can help detect and mitigate the spread of hate speech and offensive language online.

#### Please be advised that this project may not be suitable for all audiences due to the sensitive nature of the content. Viewer discretion is strongly advised.

#### The goal of my work is to combat hate speech and offensive language, and to contribute to making online spaces more respectful and inclusive. I appreciate your understanding and support in this endeavor.

This project contains the Capstone project files.

# Overview
Automatic detection of hate speech on social media platforms presents a significant challenge, particularly when it comes to distinguishing hate speech from other instances of offensive language. Traditional lexical detection methods often struggle to make this distinction, labeling any messages containing specific terms as hate speech. This lack of precision has been a limiting factor in previous studies using supervised learning models.
